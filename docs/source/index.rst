   When working with libraries to visualise data it often is an important 
   step to set up a data frame. This web site guides you through whether a
   data frame is necessary and how to create and clean up the data before
   plotting.

Pandas can help with many different tasks, once these fundamentals have been
grasped it would be beneficial to see what other methods are available
`at the Pandas website <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html>`_.
